Python library for generating random strings

## Why?
We all have been in this situation in which we had to fill the file with some text. Normally we'd just throw some Lorem Ipsum text, but what if we need specific data like names, surnames, registration numbers, words, etc. and structure it? If we do, then I suppose this library will help you.
